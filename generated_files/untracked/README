flash/generated_files/untracked

Use this folder for files generated by the flash pipeline that do not need to be checked into the git repo.  Currently this includes human_guides_38.txt, which is produced by running crisprs_sites2 on hg38.fa.  That file is so big that keeping it under source control is not useful (you can't even diff different versions).
