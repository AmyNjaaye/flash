generated_files/under_version_control/README

This folder contains most text files generated by the flash pipeline.  We keep these under version control because it's helpful to diff consecutive versions visually as changes are made to either the flash pipeline code or its inputs.

If you are committing a change to the pipeline code or inputs, and your change alters the files in this folder, please remember to add the changed files from this folder to your commit.

Files that are too big to diff should be kept in folder generated_files/untracked, outside of revision control.
