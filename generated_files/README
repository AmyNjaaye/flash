== generated_files/under_version_control ==

Contains most text files generated by the flash pipeline.  It's helpful to diff consecutive versions visually as changes are made to either the flash pipeline code or the pipeline inputs.

If you are committing a change to the pipeline code or inputs, and your change alters file(s) under_version_control, add those changes to your commit.


== generated_files/untracked ==

For generated files that should not be checked into git.  Currently this includes human_guides_38.txt, which is produced by running crisprs_sites2 on hg38.fa.  Keeping that 4.3 GB file under version control is not useful (you can't even diff different versions).
