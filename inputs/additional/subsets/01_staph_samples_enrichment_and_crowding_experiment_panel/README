Discussion leading up to the construction of this subset.

okay @channel, we have a consensus on a plan for the first order. We will are building a MRSA panel to test for enrichment and crowding effects on 10-15 existing staph samples.

Complete antibiotic families:

* methicillin
* trimethoprim
* sulfamethoxazole
* clindamycin

Targetted extra genes:

vanA, vanB, CMY-1 thru CMY-10

Using grep based on aro.py tags, these map to 308 unique DNA sequences:   https://gist.github.com/boris-dimitrov/e4c2a52540741b22e41ac548d2130f23

If we remove all but 5 of the vanco genes, we can cover with ~420 guides.

One thing that might be nice to include for our testing purposes
is a few more genes with SNPs.  Currently there is only one (plus an e coli),
folP.  Are there antibiotic resistance genes likely to occur in staph w/ snps?
Or that you have seen in these samples before from deep sequencing?

Yeah let’s do the gyr and par genes.

There should be staph specific versions of them.

OK so let’s add the following:

gyrA__NC_002952__ARO_3003296
gyrB__NC_002952__ARO_3003301
parE__D67075.1__ARO_3003314

Also ARO:3003312 which is now in our downloads from CARD.
Staphyloccocus_aureus_NCTC_8325_parC;   adding that
as manual input under additional.

hey guys, thanks for your great work on this. 
the van genes of most clinical relevance:
vanA__M97297__ARO_3000010
vanB__KF823969__ARO_3000013
VanC__AF162694__vancomycin

it seems like it would make sense, if size restrictions permit, to include the SNP guides for gyrA/B and ParE/C and rpoB in our Staph FLASH guide set
